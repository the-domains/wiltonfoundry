The Art Institute of Chicago has a real-life version of van Gogh's famous bedroom painting that you can rent on AirBNB for $10 a night.

As an impoverished artist, Vincent van Gogh would probably have made good use of Airbnb in his time, to supplement his meagre income (and pay back his brother Theo ...) or even to find a place to stay when hopping around European cities.

Now, more than a century after his death, the Dutch master has been reimagined as exactly that, an Airbnb host, by the Art Institute of Chicago, which has created a 3D replica of his Bedroom in Arles painting and posted it on the holiday rentals site.

The installation brings to life one of "the most iconic bedrooms in art", with the walls and furniture decorated in the colours and post-impressionist style that Van Gogh is famed for.

The surreal Airbnb listing was created as part of a new exhibition, Van Gogh's Bedrooms, which brings together the three paintings of the same name that the artist created while living in "The Yellow House" in Arles, Provence. 

The room, part of a larger apartment in the River North neighbourhood of Chicago, is big enough to sleep two -- and bookings have been swift. February is already fully booked, and the museum will be releasing dates for March at the end of the month.

Price shouldn't be a problem: the room is available for just $10 a night. As the host explains: "I need to buy paint."
