Multinational Flag Typeface

Luis Fabra and a team of designers have created 'multinational typeface', a 106-letter font based on national flags. By abstracting and breaking down the emblematic symbols of various countries to their most basic geometry, the designers brand each global location with both the colors and shapes that represent them most clearly. the letter forms have been designed for the Singapore branch of the international advertising firm grey as an identity tool for their own multinational team and as a clear and communicative signage tool for their new offices.

As a discourse regarding the dichotomy between 'global vs. local' continues, the designers explain their mission: 'when you set up a new hub to work with the rest of the world, it kind of makes sense to install a multinational team to do so. Not just a local setup running a global account, but a team that has got a clue about the world out there. We did just that. And we invented a design tool to brand this team, and to communicate our mindset and vision -- the world's first multinational typeface.
